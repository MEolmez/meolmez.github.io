Of course I was one of those kids who thought they would be astronouts when they grew up. I couldn't be one, but my interest in space never faded.
I got my first "telescope" when I was 10 years old, it was one of those cheap ones, taking it out of the box I thought I would be seeing Jupiter just as it is pictured on the box! Well, that was a disappointment, it could not show anything.

That gave me a lesson about researching things well before buying them. When I grow up and got a job, buying a telescope was already on my mind. So I got to researching, which showed me that best options were dobsonians for me. I thought grea, I would buy one! But turns out there were none on sale at where I lived, only options were similar to infamous Powerseeker 127EQ. Of course I refrained from buying them, I kept checking sellers for years, more than a decade actually. In that time I tried to get one shipped from overseas, but shipping cost twice the price of the telescope. When friends went aboard, I told them to buy a Skywatcher Heritage for me, they even went to the shop to buy one, but workers there could not find the scope in the shop even thought it showed they had 2 in inventory. And even though it was a small telescope, it still had a big box, so not everyone was willing to bring one via airline. 

To stratch the itch, I started trying astrophotography with my Canon 600D.
