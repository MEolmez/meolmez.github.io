When taking photos with reversed lenses for macro purposes , focused area is so small its usually necessary to move the object and take multiple photos of it with different focus points each time. While there are multiple specialized devices for this , i wanted it to be cheap and buildable from rather easily available parts.

Project uses the part that moves reading laser from an old cd-rom drive , arduino uno , easydriver for motor control , an IR led to trigger the camera and a lcd keypad shield. You can choose how many photos to take , step mode(full , half , 1/4 , 1/8) and exposure time.
